# CodyNick Raspberry Pi installation

## Current version

**Unified setup: 0.11.1; application: 0.11.1; network component: 0.2.2.**

## 0.11.1: Repository Migration

The repository is now `codynick/platform-rpi`. Installer source and release-asset URLs use the transferred repository. Success ends with **`CodyNick 0.11.1: READY`**. Published older tags and rollback payloads are unchanged. No gadget, AI-model, or network behavior changes.

## 0.11.0: Integrated Sprite Stage and Named Designs

Use the same fixed setup command. Success ends with **`CodyNick 0.11.0: READY`**.
Open Block Coding and refresh with Ctrl+F5. General contains Events, Operators,
Control, Text, Timer and Variables. Sprites contains Motion, Looks and Sensing;
Hardware contains gadget blocks. All tabs share one program and workspace.

The collapsible stage supports one rocket, movement/direction/size, glide, edge
bounce, speech, keyboard and mouse input. Sprite-only programs do not open CJP.
Gadget blocks still connect to real hardware. Click the stage to focus keyboard input.
The stage service runs unprivileged on loopback; no new packages or models are needed.

Enter a Design Name and use Save/Load for designs stored on this Pi. Overwriting,
deletion and replacing unsaved work require confirmation. Loading never runs code;
deleting a saved design leaves the open workspace and running script unchanged.
Upload/Download use `.codynick`; downloaded files use the entered name. Recovery
autosave remains separate. Existing local-prototype designs and workspaces are retained.
The demo is available at `/blocks/examples/sprite_demo.codynick` and under CodyNick
examples/blockly. The offline guide is in Start Here / Blockly Sprite Stage and Designs.

Original 0.10.3 remains selectable using `python tools/select_release.py 0.10.3`
followed by committing/pushing the selector. Users rerun the same fixed command.
Downgrade stops the sprite service but retains named designs. Older Blockly cannot
edit sprite/Timer workspaces; the current workspace is copied into the install backup
under `var/www/html/blocks/data/main.json`. Download important projects before downgrading.
Remote-server UI and Windows/Ubuntu laptop runtimes are not included.

## 0.10.3: Start/Stop and Platform Polish

Use the same fixed setup command. Success ends with **`CodyNick 0.10.3: READY`**.
IDE and Blockly now have Stop. Run explicitly restarts the student script even if
unchanged; Save after Stop does not resume it. A restricted Unix socket handles only
Start/Stop outside Apache's unchanged sandbox; the old local-test sudo rule is removed.
The watchdog remains running. Camera/microphone child processes receive the existing
graceful stop, with forced cleanup after the existing 10-second timeout if needed.
Physical LEDs can retain their last state. Simulator editing unlocks after its lease expires.

Both Events blocks have curved hats. All tools have graphical Main Panel buttons and
the supplied CodyNick favicon. Refresh with Ctrl+F5; reopen tabs if the browser retains
an old favicon. The main panel shows CJP firmware and last-detected UTC time after a
physical script handshake. Old firmware without a version shows Unknown; before the
first detection it shows Not detected yet. This is historical status, not a live probe.

Original 0.10.2 remains selectable for rollback via `python tools/select_release.py 0.10.2`
and committing/pushing the selector. Pi users keep the same fixed command.

## 0.10.2: Tool Navigation and Soil Moisture

Use the same fixed setup command. Success ends with **`CodyNick 0.10.2: READY`**.
All tools have Main Panel navigation. The simulator retains your browser hostname
(for example `http://start.codynick:8091/`) instead of redirecting to a numeric IP.
Accessing the panel by IP still retains that IP. Simulated soil moisture is 0 to
100 percent, default 50. Old scene layouts are retained; old readings above 100
are clamped to 100. Refresh tool pages with Ctrl+F5 after upgrading.
Hardware drivers, AI models, and network behavior are unchanged. Maintainers can
select original 0.10.1 with `python tools/select_release.py 0.10.1`, commit and
push the selector, and users rerun the same fixed command to downgrade.

## 0.10.1: Blockly Control and Operators

Use the same fixed setup command. Success ends with **`CodyNick 0.10.1: READY`**.
Open Block Coding from the main-menu card or `/blocks/`. Control includes wait seconds,
if/then, if/then/else, while, repeat-until, forever, and repeat N times. Operators
contains arithmetic, comparisons, and boolean operations. Control blocks are orange;
Operators are green. Existing saved workspaces are retained. Refresh with Ctrl+F5
after upgrading if an old page remains cached.

No hardware drivers, AI models, or network behavior changed. Original 0.10.0 is
available for rollback using `python tools/select_release.py 0.10.0` followed by
committing and pushing the selector; Pi users rerun the same fixed command.

## 0.10.0: Gadget Simulator

Use the same fixed install/repair/upgrade command. Success ends with **`CodyNick 0.10.0: READY`**. No PC version is included; Ubuntu 26.04 ARM64 on Raspberry Pi remains required.

Open **Gadget Simulator** in the main panel, or `http://10.42.0.1/simulator/`. It includes the tested drag-and-drop stage, saved layouts, CJP, Stand-Alone joystick, temperature, ultrasonic, soil moisture, seven-segment, scrolling/pixel LED matrix and an offline Wi-Fi/IoT model. Existing prototype layouts and tokens are retained. Browser audio requires clicking Enable sound.

Examples are under **CodyNick examples/simulator**. Add their required gadgets before running them. The on-device documentation has a Gadget Simulator reference under Start Here. No physical hardware is used by `CodyNick.Simulator()`; hardware programs keep `CodyNick.CN()` unchanged.

To change the stage's hardware set while a program is running, stop it in SSH with `sudo systemctl stop script.service`. Add/remove gadgets, then choose Run This File again. A dedicated Stop button is not included in this release.

### Easy Downgrade With the Same User Command

The updater engine is now separate from its selected application target. If this release has a problem, the maintainer can point GitHub back to the **original immutable** 0.9.10, 0.9.9 or 0.9.8 release. You then run the SAME fixed setup command. No special rollback command, SD rewrite or renamed/re-created old release is needed on the Pi.

The selected older release's original manifest and checksums determine the deployed application files and displayed version. The current compatible updater handles the migration. The simulator service is disabled on an older release and simulator-only web pages are archived; its layout/token are retained for reuse. Student files, database, Wi-Fi configuration and existing credentials are preserved. System-owned examples are replaced as usual and backed up first.

This is an **application rollback**, not an Ubuntu package, AI runtime, firmware or database snapshot rollback. Backups are stored under `/var/backups/codynick/core-*`. Verify `codynick-version` shows the selected version and `Stage: ready` afterward.

Maintainer workflow (not commands for the Pi user):

```bash
python tools/select_release.py 0.9.10
git diff -- setup.sh
git add setup.sh
git commit -m "Select original CodyNick 0.9.10 for rollback"
git push origin HEAD:main
```

Select 0.9.9 or 0.9.8 the same way; select 0.10.0 to move forward again. This changes only the active target and its immutable tag/checksum; it does not rewrite Git history or move published tags. Do not revert the entire updater to an older incompatible script: retain the current stable engine and roll back the target selector instead. Do not run `seal_core_release.py` after selecting a rollback target, because that build tool selects the new release again.

Version 0.9.10 removes the zero/below-120 restriction from the temperature dashboard example and skips NaN and missing readings instead. Use the same setup command to upgrade from 0.9.9.
Targets Ubuntu Server 26.04 ARM64 on Raspberry Pi 5. Network setup and core 0.2.2
have passed fresh-OS testing, IDE/run/live-output tests, and a CodyJoy RGB hardware
test. Version 0.3.0 adds USB-camera/object detection and colored terminal output;
USB-camera capture and default-model object detection passed the user's Pi test.
Version 0.4.0 adds the vision demos prepared for 0.3.1 plus offline English
speech-to-text and a microphone-to-RGB voice-command demo; both camera detection and
the voice LED demo passed the user's Pi tests.
Version 0.4.1 fixes same-command confirmation after hotspot handover when sudo
does not retain the SSH connection environment. Version 0.5.0 adds offline English
camera OCR, corrects the `start.codynick` homepage, retries interrupted source/OCR
downloads, and releases the setup lock before following the live log.
Version 0.5.1 adds a joystick-triggered OCR-to-RGB beginner demo. Version 0.5.2
adds the established CodyJoy countdown/cue and USB-speaker shutter sound to every
bundled camera-capture example, with a CodyJoy buzzer fallback for shutter playback.
Version 0.5.3 replaces the complete system-owned examples folder on every setup run,
uses stable camera filenames, adds adjustable OCR sensitivity and tolerant text
matching, keeps OCR result LEDs on for five seconds, and adds `codynick-version`.
Version 0.6.0 adds offline English text-to-speech, persistent named WAV files, and
separate beginner examples for generating speech once and replaying it later without
loading the TTS model again.
Version 0.6.1 repairs ownership of the restored TTS environment and models so Coqui
can update its cached configuration while running as the `client` account.
Version 0.7.0 replaces the placeholder on-device documentation with an offline guide
to the installed IDE, gadgets, dashboard, media, and AI features. It bundles gadget
images and Blockly locally. One-shot captures now release the USB camera immediately,
multi-photo demos opt in explicitly, and service restarts request graceful cleanup.
Version 0.7.1 expands that guide into a programmer's reference for the local Dashboard,
CodyNick controller Wi-Fi/cloud API, and every public CodyNick AI operation, including
signatures, parameters, return structures, examples, errors, and lifecycle rules.
Version 0.7.2 adds a password-protected offline teacher portal and its first progressive
live-coding guide. It also repairs normal-user version reporting and makes the main
panel's software version and release date update with every release.
Version 0.7.3 restricts CodyJoy Pro discovery to USB serial devices, removes redundant
pre-scan/open delays, waits a tested fixed two seconds after opening, and requires the
exact CodyJoy Pro identity. It does not cache ports, retry identification, or offer
multi-device selection yet.
Version 0.7.4 adds public, copyable test pages for eleven gadget groups, keeps their
Markdown sources in a separately managed on-device folder, revises the temperature
presenter guide, removes seven-segment debug noise, and improves multi-LED reliability.
Version 0.7.5 repairs the 0.7.4 Windows line-ending checksum defect and makes release
sealing checksum Git-normalized text, while preserving the same user-facing features.
Version 0.7.6 adds the first AI transition to the presenter guide: connect a USB camera,
capture one reusable image, and preview it from the IDE.
Version 0.7.7 completes the first presenter path with camera sounds, object detection,
voice-controlled LEDs, and a managed temperature/color display example.
Version 0.7.8 adds the tested temperature alarm/inhibit behavior and a managed
CodyJoy Pro joystick, LED-region, and high-note hardware test.
Version 0.8.1 adds a pinned local Gemma 3 1B Q4 model, explicit model loading,
short-question generation and cleanup controls. Version 0.8.2 adds `load_stt()`,
updates the voice examples and references, makes the Local AI example compatible with
the IDE, and prefers IPv4 for setup downloads.
Version 0.9.0 adds the tested local-AI voice conversation and migrates the hotspot to
boot-time selection among non-DFS 5 GHz channels. Cloned images receive a unique
hardware-derived identity and hotspot name.
Version 0.9.1 fixes hotspot startup on Ubuntu 26.04, whose `iw` output reports
5 GHz frequencies with a decimal suffix such as `5180.0 MHz`.
Version 0.9.2 disables automatic Ubuntu package updates, repairs interrupted or
corrupted package-manager prerequisites, adds persistent installation logs and
status commands, synchronizes hotspot identity with the web panel, and installs
the offline CodyJoy Pro HEX-programming guide.
Version 0.9.9 expands the teacher presenter guide with a live dashboard reveal and a Local AI conversation finale. Version 0.9.8 adds the tested temperature dashboard example with missing-reading handling, a non-zero/below-120 filter, and elapsed seconds on the graph. Version 0.9.6 added configurable graph axes, five-line grids, one-based samples, and card height spans. Version 0.9.5 redraws charts at their real responsive size for sharp, undistorted output. Version 0.9.4 added responsive dashboard card widths and a live temperature-history example. Version 0.9.3 added safe per-widget dashboard typography and alignment controls,
plus simple dashboard-counter and LED-matrix temperature demonstrations.
Version 0.7.11 repaired the upgrade gate for devices coming from 0.7.9 or the failed
0.7.10 attempt. Version 0.7.10 replaced the fixed controller startup delay with adaptive polling: fast
units connect immediately, while slower CodyJoy Pro units have up to five seconds to
identify. Version 0.7.9 added a wake-phrase conversation demo, overwrite-safe prerecorded answer
generation, multi-question sessions, sleep commands, expressive gadget feedback, and
an offline compact platform knowledge base for AI coding agents.

The matching CodyPi firmware source is `firmware/CodyPi/CodyPi.ino`, version 1.19.4.
Its former blocking `delay(2000)` remains disabled while joystick initialization and
calibration remain enabled. The Raspberry Pi setup command does not flash CodyPi;
install this firmware separately before testing the shortened host delay.

**Use this same command for first installation, a supported upgrade, or application
repair. Already on the verified hotspot? Run it now without rewriting the SD card:**

```bash
wget -4 -O /tmp/codynick-setup.sh "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codynick/platform-rpi/main/setup.sh?$(date +%s)" && sudo bash /tmp/codynick-setup.sh
```

It chooses the required stage and shows the installation log. It accepts core
0.2.0, 0.2.1, 0.2.2, 0.3.0, the unpublished 0.3.1 candidate, 0.4.0, 0.5.0,
0.5.1, 0.5.2, 0.5.3, 0.6.0, 0.6.1, 0.7.0, 0.7.1, 0.7.2, 0.7.3, 0.7.4, 0.7.5, 0.7.6, 0.7.7, 0.7.8, 0.7.9, failed 0.7.10, 0.7.11, 0.8.1, 0.8.2, 0.9.0, 0.9.1, 0.9.2, 0.9.3, 0.9.4, 0.9.5, 0.9.6, 0.9.7, 0.9.8, and repeats of 0.9.9. Upstream stage scripts/assets are pinned
to immutable versions with SHA256 checks. Only the small entry point follows main;
the application and network stages use fixed release tags.

On a fresh OS, the network switch still disconnects SSH. Join the displayed Pi
hotspot, reconnect at 10.42.0.1, and run **the same command** within 15 minutes.
It performs the network confirmation and continues to applications. No separate
`--confirm` command is required with this entry point. Answer its confirmation prompt.

Have the USB webcam and a USB microphone (a webcam microphone is acceptable)
connected. Version 0.6.0 adds approximately **964 MB** of TTS downloads. A fresh
installation downloads about **1.4 GB** across all application assets. Allow at least
6 GB free storage. Downloads are cached and verified; repair restores managed runtime
files. Face features and chapter 8 are not installed yet. TTS hardware acceptance is
pending, so this remains a staged hardware trial, not a production fleet updater.

## 1. Prepare before installation

Before powering on the Pi for setup, prepare an external router or phone hotspot:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| External internet Wi-Fi SSID | `codynick` |
| External internet Wi-Fi password | `codynick` |

Keep this network powered on and connected to the internet throughout installation.
For the tested RTL8188EUS adapter, make a 2.4 GHz network available. This external
network is different from the hotspot the Pi will create.

In Raspberry Pi Imager, write **Ubuntu Server 26.04 ARM64** and configure:

- An administrator account (examples use `admin`) and password or SSH key.
- SSH access.
- Built-in Wi-Fi to join `codynick` with password `codynick`.
- The Wi-Fi country appropriate to the Pi's physical location.

Connect the USB Wi-Fi dongle before booting. Ethernet with internet access is also
supported as an alternative uplink. Do not configure the dongle manually.
Keep local terminal access available for recovery during this trial.

## 2. Complete first boot, then reboot

Allow Ubuntu's first-boot initialization to finish.

**Reboot before running the CodyNick installer or doing any other setup.** On the tested
image, built-in Wi-Fi does not reliably connect to `codynick` until this reboot.
Do not power off while first-boot initialization is still running.

From the local terminal, or SSH if already available:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

After reboot, log in locally or connect through MobaXterm using the Pi's address on
the external network, your administrator account, and port 22. Find the address in
the router's client list, or display it locally:

```bash
hostname -I
```

This initial DHCP address can change. Do not assume it matches a previous SD card.

## 3. Run the single setup command

```bash
wget -4 -O /tmp/codynick-setup.sh "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codynick/platform-rpi/main/setup.sh?$(date +%s)" && sudo bash /tmp/codynick-setup.sh
```

The entry banner is **0.10.0** and its pinned network component reports **0.2.2**.
On first installation, answer `y` to
`Prepare this network handover? [y/N]`.

The installer installs prerequisites, detects adapters, and verifies HTTPS internet
through Ethernet or the dongle before switching built-in Wi-Fi. Ethernet is preferred
when both uplinks are available.

At `Switch to the hotspot now? [y/N]`, record the displayed hotspot name and answer
`y`. Your existing SSH connection will disconnect during this deliberate switch.

## 4. Join the hotspot and confirm

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Pi hotspot SSID | `codynick-` plus the last eight hardware serial digits |
| Example SSID | `codynick-d82c57b4` |
| Pi hotspot password | `CodyNick12345` |
| Pi hotspot/SSH address | `10.42.0.1` |
| SSH username | Your existing administrator, such as `admin` |
| SSH authentication | Your existing administrator password or key |

Connect your computer to this hotspot. Open MobaXterm SSH to `10.42.0.1`, or run
this on your computer (substitute your username if different):

```bash
ssh admin@10.42.0.1
```

From that SSH session, confirm within **15 minutes**:

```bash
wget -4 -O /tmp/codynick-setup.sh "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codynick/platform-rpi/main/setup.sh?$(date +%s)" && sudo bash /tmp/codynick-setup.sh
```

Answer `y`. Success reports `Stage: network-ready` and disables rollback, then the
same entry point starts application installation. Wait for `CodyNick 0.10.0: READY`
before rebooting. No root password is set. The older internal network helper may
still mention `--confirm`; the unified entry point invokes it for you.

When upgrading an existing device, the active hotspot remains unchanged until the
installation reaches `READY`. Reboot afterward to activate automatic 5 GHz channel
selection. A cloned image receives the new Pi's serial suffix and new SSH host keys.

Without confirmation, the timer is intended to restore the previous network.
A reboot before confirmation restarts its 15-minute interval. The original
router-assigned IP address may change after restoration.

## 5. Verify after reboot

After confirmation:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

Reconnect to the same hotspot and SSH at `10.42.0.1`, then run:

```bash
sudo codynick-setup --check
```

Expected results:

- `Stage: network-ready`.
- Built-in Wi-Fi has `10.42.0.1/24`.
- The dongle has an external address and route metric `200` when used.
- `ssh`, `codynick-ap.service`, `codynick-dhcp.service`, and `codynick-nat.service` are active.
- Your computer can browse the internet through the Pi hotspot.

Ethernet can show `DOWN` without a cable. Changes in the dongle's DHCP address are
normal; the hotspot address remains `10.42.0.1`.

**Keep this SD card.** Use the unified command for application repair/upgrade.
The optional network-only `--check` command above checks just the network component.

## 6. Applications and USB-camera acceptance test

**Already connected to the verified hotspot? Start here. Do not rewrite the SD card
or repeat the network handover.** Keep the external internet network available.

Run these commands in the Pi's existing administrator SSH session at `10.42.0.1`:

```bash
wget -4 -O /tmp/codynick-setup.sh "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codynick/platform-rpi/main/setup.sh?$(date +%s)" && sudo bash /tmp/codynick-setup.sh
```

Installation runs in the background, so closing SSH does not stop it. Do not reboot
or power off until it finishes. The command automatically follows its log.
Wait for **`CodyNick 0.10.0: READY`**, then press
`Ctrl+C` to leave the log display. If you see `INSTALLATION FAILED`, send the last
30-50 log lines for diagnosis; do not continue as though installation succeeded.

Open [Python IDE](http://10.42.0.1/code/) in your computer's browser. Create a file,
paste this test, and click **Run this File**:

```python
import time
for number in range(10):
    print("CodyNick test", number, flush=True)
    time.sleep(1)
```

The terminal under the editor should receive one line per second. Click Run again
while it is running: output should restart from zero. Also open the
[dashboard](http://10.42.0.1/dashboard/) and [block editor](http://10.42.0.1/blocks/).
Some editor assets currently use external CDNs, so keep internet access available.

**USB-camera/YOLO test:** In the IDE, open `CodyNick examples/camera_objects.py`
and click **Run this File**. The script finds USB video devices, plays the CodyJoy
get-ready cue and USB-speaker shutter sound, captures an image,
loads YOLO nano, and prints object detections. Point the webcam at ordinary objects
such as a chair, bottle, or cup. Zero detections is a valid result for an empty or
unrecognized scene, not proof of a broken installation.

The camera-open message should be green, without visible escape codes. Open the
IDE's **Images** section to inspect `usb_camera_test.jpg` and the annotated output
under `results`. The example closes its camera/worker when finished. Installation
itself does not capture photos: it validates the Python runtime and model warmup.
If capture fails, send the IDE terminal output; camera hardware confirmation remains
separate from the installer READY status. Close other programs using the webcam.

**USB-camera/OCR test:** In the IDE, open `CodyNick examples/camera_read_text.py`
and click **Run this File**. Hold a page or card with large printed English text in
good light. The script captures one photo, corrects a document-like perspective when
possible, reads the text offline with the standard model, and prints text-region and
average-confidence results. Inspect the original picture, annotated picture, and JSON
result in **Images/results**. It uses the same capture sounds as the object demo. No
photo or recognized text is sent to a cloud service.

**Offline TTS test:** Open `CodyNick examples/create_speech_file.py` and click
**Run this File**. The first run loads the English model and creates
`/home/client/audio/welcome_message.wav`. Preview it in the IDE's **Audio** section.
Then run `play_saved_audio.py`; it plays the existing file without loading TTS.
Run both again to confirm the generator leaves the named file unchanged and playback
reuses it. A USB audio output must be connected for the playback test.

### Installed scope and credentials

| Item | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Web applications | `/var/www/html`: Python IDE/live log, Blockly, dashboard, documentation |
| Python libraries and student code | `/home/client`; CodyNick.py 1.21.1 and Dashboard.py |
| Public gadget-test sources | `/home/client/CodyNick Gadget Tests`; replaced on every setup run |
| Script watcher | `/root/codynick`, `codynick.service` |
| Student script execution | `script.service`, runs as `client`, unbuffered output to `/home/client/log.log` |
| Student Python runtime | `/home/client/.codynick-ai/envs/controller/bin/python` (bundled Python 3.10); keyboard, PySerial, requests, MySQL connector, NumPy/OpenCV |

`CodyNick Gadget Tests` is system-managed. Setup deliberately replaces its contents
with the current official tests, so users must keep their own programs elsewhere.
| YOLO worker | `/home/client/.codynick-ai/envs/yolo/bin/python`; models in `/home/client/.deepface/weights`; AI source in `/home/client/vhl_object_detection` |
| OCR worker | `/home/client/.codynick-ai/envs/ocr/bin/python`; offline English fast/standard/best Tesseract models |
| TTS worker | `/home/client/.codynick-ai/envs/tts/bin/python`; offline English Glow-TTS with MultiBand-MelGAN |
| Saved audio | `/home/client/audio`; named files persist and appear in the IDE Audio section |
| SSH administrator | Existing username/password or key, unchanged |
| New client account | `client` / `codynick`; existing account passwords are not reset |
| Dashboard database | Database/user/password: `codynick` / `codynick` / `codynick`; database-scoped permissions |
| Root login/password | Unchanged; root login is not required |
| AI environments/models | USB-camera capture, YOLO nano/small/medium, offline English speech commands, English OCR fast/standard/best, and English TTS |

This is a trusted-classroom-network application, not an internet-facing service.
The IDE does not provide user authentication or isolate students from one another.
Do not forward its web or SSH ports to the internet. Change default account passwords
before deployment outside a controlled classroom. Installing `keyboard` fixes its
import; Linux keyboard-hook operations may still require privileges and are not
validated by the import check.

### Repeating, checking, and recovering

**If 0.2.0 or 0.2.1 failed at the www-data write-access check, run the three commands above.**
No manual permission commands or SD-card rewrite are required. Version 0.6.1 accepts
failed and completed 0.2.0/0.2.1 installations and repairs web-user access with explicit
ACLs. It grants traversal of `/home` and `/home/client`, writes to the active script
and log, and shared-folder access. It does not grant writes to the whole client home.
On upgrades, the old `/opt/codynick/core-0.2.0` environment is retained, but the
student service now uses the bundled controller environment documented above.
Actual file opens are checked without truncating data, and disposable files test folder
create/read/rename/delete operations. No external `test -w` gates those checks.
Failures include identity, path, and ACL diagnostics. The 0.2.1 Pi log shows correct
ACLs/group membership but a failing `test -w`; its exact cause is still unconfirmed.

Repeat the same download/run commands to retry or repair **this core version**. It
rechecks dependencies and redeploys managed application files. It preserves saved
Python files outside `CodyNick examples`, active_script.py, media, logs, dashboard
records, web configuration, saved Blockly arrangements/packages, and existing account
passwords. The running student script is restarted during installation.

**`CodyNick examples` is a system-owned folder.** Every setup run backs up its old
contents, removes the complete live folder, and installs the current release set.
Do not save student work there because edits and extra files will disappear from the
live folder during installation, repair, or upgrade. The recovery copy is stored in
that run's `/var/backups/codynick/core-*` folder.

The application phase performs no OS-wide upgrade, reboot, root-password reset, or
network reconfiguration. A legacy installation or a version other than
0.2.0/0.2.1/0.2.2/0.3.0/0.3.1/0.4.0/0.5.0/0.5.1/0.5.2/0.5.3/0.6.0/0.6.1/0.7.0/0.7.1/0.7.2/0.7.3/0.7.4/0.7.5/0.7.6/0.7.7/0.7.8/0.7.9/0.7.10/0.7.11/0.8.1/0.8.2/0.9.0/0.9.1/0.9.2/0.9.3/0.9.4/0.9.5/0.9.6/0.9.7/0.9.8/0.9.9 is refused
rather than blindly overwritten. Other migrations are not yet implemented.
Edited managed source files are backed up before replacement;
this is not a full-system/database backup or transactional rollback. Back up important
student data separately before any deployment.

To view the installed component versions and run health checks:

```bash
sudo python3 /usr/local/lib/codynick/core-0.10.0/app_setup.py --check
```

For a compact version report and checksum status for every system example:

```bash
codynick-version
```

Each example is reported as `current`, `modified`, or `missing`; extra files are
reported as `unexpected`. Rerun the unified setup command to replace a changed
examples folder with the current set.

The offline presenter library is available at `http://10.42.0.1/teachers/`. Its
initial login is `teacher` / `codynick`. Change that default from an administrator
terminal; the new password is preserved by later repairs and upgrades:

```bash
sudo codynick-teacher-password
```

To retrieve the latest installation output after reconnecting:

```bash
codynick-install-log
```

State is stored in `/var/lib/codynick/application-state.json`. Only a successful
health check records `stage: ready`. Backups of replaced payload files are under
`/var/backups/codynick/core-*`. Interrupted installations can leave partially updated
applications; rerun this same release after addressing the reported error. Installation
does not automatically resume after a power failure/reboot. The verified hotspot
configuration is left untouched.

**Repair limits:** the single entry point requires a bootable OS, administrator
access, and working internet. It can start stopped existing network units, but it
does not reconstruct arbitrary missing/corrupt network state or unsupported legacy
installs. Runtime files are restored from the pinned snapshot; unknown conflicting
symlinks cause a safe failure. It is not a guarantee of recovery from every kind of
SD-card/OS damage. Keep an SD backup and do not downgrade by rerunning an old installer.

Application data and examples remain preserved. |
| **0.4.1-setup** | Clean-install retest pending | The second run recognizes the saved pending/applying network stage and opens confirmation without relying on SSH environment variables. Application payload remains 0.4.0. |
| **0.4.0-speech** | Voice LED hardware test passed on user's Pi | Offline English speech-to-text, constrained voice commands, microphone-to-RGB demo, and the camera/counting/model-comparison demos prepared in the unpublished 0.3.1 candidate. Reuses verified 0.3.0 vision assets. |
| 0.3.1-vision | Unpublished candidate, folded into 0.4.0 | Renamed camera demo, per-photo object counting, and sequential nano/small/medium comparison on one photo. |
| 0.3.0-vision | USB capture and default-model object detection passed on user's Pi | Single setup entry point, in-place upgrades from core 0.2.x, bundled ARM64 controller/YOLO runtime and models, USB-camera IDE example, safe ANSI terminal colors, bounded output, and log-rotation handling. OCR/speech/chapter 8 remain deferred. |
| 0.2.2-core | Fresh-OS, IDE/run/live-output, and RGB hardware tests passed on user's Pi | Replaced the failing external test -w gate with actual file/folder operations. Baseline for 0.3.0 upgrade. |
| 0.2.1-core | Superseded: test -w still failed on Pi | Added explicit ACLs and diagnostics. The log confirmed correct file modes, ACLs, and group membership, but the preliminary test prevented the real-open probe from running. |
| 0.2.0-core | Superseded: Pi health check failed on www-data write access | Introduced detached core installation, IDE/live terminal, Blockly, dashboard, dependencies, and script/watchdog services. Python/database checks passed on the Pi, but READY was not reached. |
| **0.2.0** | Automated migration/channel tests; Pi acceptance pending | Selects a permitted non-DFS 5 GHz channel at boot and repairs identity after image cloning. |
| **0.1.2** | Superseded after fresh-install and reboot tests | Corrects inherited file-creation permissions so networkd can read generated Netplan files. |
| 0.1.1 | Superseded; do not install | Reuses a correct working dongle profile, targets USB preparation instead of global Netplan application, arms rollback earlier, and retries recovery. Fresh-install testing subsequently found the permissions defect fixed in 0.1.2. |
| 0.1.0 | Superseded; do not install | Introduced adapter detection, internet checks, hotspot handover, confirmation, rollback, and version/state reporting. Global Netplan application could disconnect SSH during preparation. |

The unified 0.10.0 setup updates both the core application and network component.
See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for technical details.

**For every future published version**, update this table, current-version section,
download URL, prerequisites, tested scope, and changelog. Explain what changed and
any required user action. Keep published tags unchanged; fixes receive new versions.

## Recovery

Recover interrupted old attempts before installing again. Do not delete the setup lock
file: its owner must release it. Recovery can disconnect SSH as original networking
returns; use local access or a recovery process independent of SSH.

From a local terminal:

```bash
sudo codynick-setup --rollback
```

If it reports `Resource temporarily unavailable`, identify the other setup process
before stopping it. Backups are stored under `/var/backups/codynick/`.

## Next stage

1. Install 0.6.1 on the Pi and test TTS ownership repair, named speech
   generation, repeated playback, Audio preview, repair, and reboot persistence.
2. Package face features later, retaining existing on-device paths and student data.
3. Add verified migrations and recovery for later releases, then test the complete
   clean-OS procedure before recommending fleet-wide upgrades.

Chapter 8 will be a separate upgrade. Keep this SD card for the next stage.

## AI demo gallery (0.6.0)

Open `CodyNick examples` in the IDE and select **Run This File**:

| Script | Demo |
| --- | --- |
| `camera_objects.py` | Capture one photo, print labels/scores, save an annotated image. |
| `object_counter.py` | Count `bottle` in five photos. Edit TARGET to another YOLO label. Counts are per-photo, not unique tracked objects across time. |
| `model_comparison.py` | Capture one photo, run nano/small/medium sequentially at the same threshold, and print load time and median of three detection calls. Each model saves its own annotated image. |
| `voice_led_colors.py` | Listen offline for English color commands and set all 16 RGB LEDs. Say lights off or stop listening to finish. |
| `camera_read_text.py` | Capture printed English text, run offline standard OCR, print confidence, and save annotated JPG plus JSON results. |
| `joystick_ocr_led.py` | Wait for CodyJoy Pro joystick UP, capture text, then fill all RGB LEDs green for `codynick` or red otherwise. |
| `create_speech_file.py` | Generate `welcome_message.wav` once with offline English TTS and keep it in the Audio folder. An existing file is not regenerated. |
| `play_saved_audio.py` | Play `welcome_message.wav` through the selected USB audio output without loading or running the TTS model. |

Each demo uses one stable base name and overwrites its previous images/results instead
of accumulating random names. Model comparison keeps three stable annotated outputs,
one per model. Find annotations under Images/results. Every camera-capture demo uses
CodyJoy for its get-ready cue and a USB audio output for the shutter sound;
if USB playback is unavailable, CodyJoy plays a fallback shutter cue. These demos use
the USB webcam and existing models, with no cloud credentials or extra downloads.
Larger models may take longer and use more RAM. Comparison excludes an untimed
detection and image saving from timed calls. It measures full controller calls,
not pure inference; counts/scores are not accuracy measurements. Inspect the images.

The voice demo uses a constrained command list: red, green, blue, yellow, white,
purple, lights off, and stop listening. It automatically selects an ALSA USB/webcam
microphone, prints accepted commands and model confidence scores, and turns the LEDs
off when it exits. Recognition is offline; audio is streamed to the local worker and
is not saved or sent to a cloud service.

Set `OCR_CONFIDENCE` in either OCR example to adjust filtering: lower values accept
more uncertain text and higher values are stricter. In `joystick_ocr_led.py`,
`MATCH_SIMILARITY` controls tolerance for small OCR mistakes. The defaults are `0.20`
and `0.80`. Configurable uplink credentials, dongle replacement reconciliation, and
swap remain postponed; version 0.6.1 does not add them.

Generated speech is stored under `/home/client/audio` and remains available after the
program exits or the Pi reboots. Change `AUDIO_NAME` and `TEXT` in
`create_speech_file.py` to create another reusable message. Run
`play_saved_audio.py` whenever it is needed. Playback uses a private converted-audio
cache under `/home/client/.cache/codynick/audio`; the visible Audio folder contains
only the named student files. The first TTS model load can take noticeably longer
than later playback.

## Implementation and testing

- Retains systemd-networkd; does not introduce NetworkManager.
- Uses detected Wi-Fi interface names; networkd Netplan Wi-Fi does not accept `match`.
- Ethernet route metric: `100`; USB metric after handover: `200`.
- Does not flush existing firewall rules. Active UFW requires a reviewed setup.
- Setup state: `/var/lib/codynick/network-setup.json`.
- Disables only cloud-init network generation, not cloud-init itself.
- Keeps credential configuration and backups private on the device.
- Selects only permitted non-DFS 5 GHz channels 36, 40, 44, and 48 at boot.
- Pins a tag and verifies the helper SHA256: HTTPS/checksum integrity, not release signing.

Automated tests cover the 0.10.0 application and 0.2.2 network migration:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

```bash
bash -n bootstrap/codynick-setup.sh
```

Tests cover configuration preservation, interface detection, channel scoring and
fallback, clone identity, HTTPS binding, confirmation, rollback, and subprocess
permissions. Hardware acceptance remains required on the target Pi and client devices.
